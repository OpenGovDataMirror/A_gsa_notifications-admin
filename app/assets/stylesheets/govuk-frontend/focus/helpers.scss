/// Removes the visible outline and replace with box-shadow and background colour.
/// Used for interactive text-based elements.

@mixin govuk-focusable-text-link {
  &:focus {
    // When colours are overridden, for example when users have a dark mode,
    // backgrounds and box-shadows disappear, so we need to ensure there's a
    // transparent outline which will be set to a visible colour.

    outline: $govuk-focus-width solid transparent;
    color: $govuk-focus-text-colour;
    background-color: $govuk-focus-colour;
    box-shadow: 0 -2px $govuk-focus-colour, 0 4px $govuk-focus-text-colour;
    // When link is focussed, hide the default underline since the
    // box shadow adds the "underline"
    text-decoration: none;
